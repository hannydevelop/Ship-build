Building projects with vessel.js

I'm trying to import a vessel project I created few years ago into my Github account. 
However, this project hasn't been a smooth one as I don't want to deal with Vesseljs files directly. You can read more about this [here](https://github.com/shiplab/vesseljs/issues/170).
